# guitarKey
Guitar learning assistant that identifies keys, provides chords and their shapes/variations, and lookup songs to learn in the same key!

### Objective
Provide a user friendly song writing assistant app that uses basic musical keys to help users develop their musical acumen. The Guitar Key will be developed to be used with a six string guitar. The Guitar Key will also leverage APIs to provide songs to learn alongside the respective key and to provide alternate chord shapes for each chord in the key.
### Value
With little to no focus on music theory, The Guitar Key will drive users to learn how to play songs and how to play in key. Most guitar playing is improvisation and self-taught. The basic philosophy behind The Guitar Key parallels conventional learning methods and should better assist with guitar playing development.
